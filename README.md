# Better Lyrics Shaders

A browser extension that adds beautiful animated backgrounds to YouTube Music using [Kawarp](https://kawarp.boidu.dev) - creating fluid, warped visuals from album artwork. Built with Plasmo, React, and TypeScript.

> [!WARNING]
> This extension is specifically designed to be used with Play Music and may not function properly when run in a standard web browser.
>
> Although optional, it is also **highly recommended** to use this extension alongside [Better Lyrics](https://github.com/boidushya/better-lyrics).

## Features

- **Fluid Animated Backgrounds**: Album artwork transforms into smooth, warped visuals using Kawarp
- **Video Ambient Colors**: During music videos, the background follows the video itself, with its own look and motion controls in the **Video** tab. Audio-only tracks, ads, and videos the browser can't read fall back to album artwork.
- **High-precision Output**: On HDR displays, supported browsers draw into a 16-bit floating-point canvas, which reduces banding in dark gradients. Brightness stays in the normal SDR range.
- **Animated Album Art**: Displays animated album artwork (video loops) when available
- **Audio Reactive**: Beat detection syncs effects with music for a pulsing, dynamic experience
- **Real-time Configuration**: Adjust settings and see changes instantly via the popup
- **Persistent Settings**: Configuration saved automatically across sessions
- **Multi-page Support**: Works on player pages, homepage, and search results
- **Cross-browser**: Supports Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Brave, Arc, and other Chromium browsers

## Video controls

The **Video** tab only affects music videos. **Look** and **Motion** still configure album artwork. Video settings are saved, exported, imported, and reset with everything else.

- **Appearance:** opacity, color smoothing, warp strength, blur passes (0 skips the blur), saturation, dithering, and how much dithering to keep on an HDR display. **Dim bright frames** is the same toggle as the artwork setting, with its own strength, response time, and sampling rate for video.

Color smoothing defaults to 250 ms. It blends color changes over time, so flashes and strobes in a video do not flash the whole background. Below 250 ms the popup shows a warning, because the background then follows flashing much more closely. Keep it at 250 ms or higher if flashing light can trigger seizures for you.
- **Motion:** animation speed, beat response, beat speed boost, beat zoom, and zoom attack and release. Beats come from the shared detector in **Audio**, but the video boost amounts are separate from the artwork ones.
- **Sampling:** the size of the sampled color map (208 × 117 by default), a frame rate limit (0 follows the video), and how aggressively each downsampling step shrinks the frame.

Kawarp does the video work on the GPU: each decoded frame is shrunk in steps, smoothed over time, and blurred, without reading full frames back to JavaScript. Dimming reads a 32 × 32 thumbnail asynchronously, at most every 100 ms. While the video is paused it only measures again after a seek. If the video stops being readable for more than a moment, the background crossfades back to the album artwork.

With logging enabled, each canvas reports whether it got a float16 drawing buffer and, in video mode, whether color smoothing keeps float32 history.

## Building for Production

```bash
pnpm build    # Build for all browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
pnpm package  # Package for distribution

## Troubleshooting

### Effect not showing

- Ensure you're on [music.youtube.com](https://music.youtube.com) (not youtube.com)
- Check that the extension is enabled in settings
- Try refreshing the page
- Navigate to a player page (start playing a song)

### Audio reactive not working

- Check that "Audio Responsive" is enabled in settings
- Adjust "Beat Threshold" if detection is too sensitive or not sensitive enough

### Performance issues

- Disable "Show on Browse Pages" to limit effects to player page only
- The effect automatically pauses when the tab is not visible

### Animated album art not showing

- Not all songs have animated artwork available
- Ensure "Animated Album Art" is enabled in settings
- The feature queries [artwork.boidu.dev](https://github.com/boidushya/artwork.boidu.dev) for availability
